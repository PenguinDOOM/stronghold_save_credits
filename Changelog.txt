Fixed v4 changelog.
Added "Display_Progress" command

How to use "Display_Progress"
-----------------------
] pukename Display_Progress [Map number](optional argument)
-----------------------
This prints all progress to the client's console.
Adding an argument will print the progress of the map accordingly.
It only shows whether the map has been cleared or not, it does not show the clear time.

If nothing is added or 0 is added as an argument, only the server bank will be deleted.
If you add 1 to the argument, the completed stage data will be deleted.

"StrPaidInitialBankFee" is now saved. Now you don't have to pay 800 credits every time to use the bank.
You can now load credits on the way, not just when you join. You can bind from control options.
